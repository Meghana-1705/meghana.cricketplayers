    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>

    <p>Sachin Tendulkar (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India) is an Indian professional cricket player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In 2012, he became the first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in international play.

A year later he scored a century on his first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205 days he became Indiaâ€™s youngest Test (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989.</p>

        <p>Thousands of fans filled a stadium in the Indian capital, Delhi, as Virat Kohli made his much-anticipated return to domestic cricket after more than 12 years.

            The 36-year-old star batter turned out for Delhi on Thursday in the Ranji Trophy match against the Railways team at the Arun Jaitley stadium.
            
            Kohli's return follows the national cricket board's directive for contracted players to play domestic cricket after India's 3-1 Border-Gavaskar Trophy loss to Australia.
            
            It also comes amid a personal lean patch in Test cricket, where the former Indian captain has struggled for consistency in recent years.</p>
